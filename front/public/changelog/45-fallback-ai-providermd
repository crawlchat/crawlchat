When your configured AI provider (OpenRouter) fails or times out, CrawlChat now automatically falls back to OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini.

- If the primary model fails after retries, CrawlChat switches to OpenAI on the final attempt
- Ensures you still get an answer during provider outages, rate limits, or transient errors
- OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini is fast, cost-effective, and widely reliable
