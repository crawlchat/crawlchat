title: Set channel names and reply as thread for Discord
date: 2025-08-28
type: changelog
---

Release two features to manage the [Discord](/discord-bot) bot so that the channels are clutter free.

1. You can configure the Discord bot **reply the messages** as thread. This makes sure that the conversations are neatly grouped, makes the users to keep track of the threads easy, and keeps the main channel clutter free

2. Now you can set what **channels the bot should listen on**. If configured, the bot will not reply when some tags the bot from the other channels. Again, very useful to make sure that the community uses the bot only in designated channels.

You can configure above items from the [Discord settings](/connect/discord) page on your dashboard.
