We've improved the navigation for integration options in the side menu. All integration methods are now organized under a single **Integrate** menu item, making it easier to find and access different ways to connect your knowledge base.

The Integrate menu includes:

- **Customise** - Customize your integration appearance and behavior
- **Web embed** - Embed the chat widget on your website
- **Discord bot** - Connect your knowledge base to Discord
- **Slack app** - Integrate with your Slack workspace
- **MCP** - Model Context Protocol server integration
- **API** - Using the answering engine through API

This new structure provides a cleaner, more organized way to access all integration options from one place in the side menu.
