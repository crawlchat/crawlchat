Tags are now automatically generated from your conversations and displayed on the summary page. They help you identify common topics and patterns in user questions.

The tags section shows:

- **Tag name** - The category or topic identified from conversations
- **Count** - How many times this tag has appeared
- **Sorting options** - View tags by "Top" (most frequent) or "Latest" (most recent)

Tags are derived from category suggestions that are automatically generated when analyzing messages, making it easier to understand what topics your users are asking about most frequently.
