**API access** to CrawlChat is out now. You can integrate CrawlChat to your application. To start with, the `/answer` API is public now. You can use this API to get an answer from your _knowledge base_ for any query, just like you get it on the chat widget. Check [docs](https://docs.crawlchat.app/category/api) for more information.
